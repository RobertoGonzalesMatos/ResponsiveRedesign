              Analysis of MamiSinCancer's currect webpage
            </h2>
            <p>
              Before going into the analysis, the reason why I chose this
              website because it relates to the NGO that I created to fight
              against cancer. This page was made with wix but now it needs a
              redesign given the time that has passed. To make MamisinCancerâ€™s
              outreach greater, having a good website is important. Here is the
              current version:
            </p>
            <a
              href="https://mamisincancer.wixsite.com/my-site-4"
              target="_blank"
            >
              MamisinCancer
            </a>

            <p>
              Lets start the analysis by going through the page and identifying
              elements that could hinder the usabulity learnability or
              accesibility of the page.

                  The main issues here lie on the abundance of different colors
                  and the odd spacing and padding which may make it hard to read
                  or find items for people with disabilities. Additinoally,
                  having no indication or control over the carousel makes it
                  hard to use and learn as the images take a decent amount of
                  time to change. This makes it so users may miss critical
                  information because of the poor style choices or the hard
                  discoverability of components.

                  In this part the main isues come from the unnecesary
                  repetition of information because it is written in engligh and
                  spanish. Additionally, many of the fonts used seem like they
                  are buttons when they aren't making it confusing and hard to
                  learn. Finally, the lack of cohesion in padding and margins
                  makes the page visually unappealing meaning users may not want
                  to continue exploring other parts of the site.

                  order. Infact some of the texts cuts off and is unreadable for
                  the user. All of this discourages the user from interacting
                  with the page and learn about prevention and our work.

                  WebAim Wave mainly had issues with visibility regarding

                  readable but they are hard to look at because of all of the
                  added italics + bold + font size. Additionally we have an

                  Overall, the main issues regarding accesibility come from the
                  abundance of colors, fonts and sizes in the page which makes
                  the text hard to read or visually unappealing. Additionally,
                  there is an abundance in repetition of information in engligh
                  and spanish. There are elements like the carousel which are
                  hard to learn and use. Also The navigation bar is purely in
                  spanish so the page doesn't even fully account for both types
                  of langauges. Moreover, some of the texts cuts off and some of
                  the titles seems like buttons. This makes the process of
                  discovery and usage very unintuitive and confusing. It is also
                  not very efficient at delivering the message of the importance
                  of prevention and what the organization has done as there is
                  too much clutter. At last, the webpage is not responsive at
                  all to changes in aspect ratios. Below we can see a screenshot
                  of mobile versions:

              Visual Redesign

            <h3 className="imageTextSmall">
              For the Visual Design Style guide I decided to first start by
              picking the colors. Having a reduced coherent set of colors would
              help make the page easier for the eyes. This same argument can be
              applied for the fonts and sizes of text. Additionally, components
              like the toggle button or symbols like the prevention one were
              chosen to decrease the number of words in the page. Making easier
              for the users to navigate the page.
            </h3>
            <h3 className="imageTextSmall">
              Fun fact, this analysis webpage was also made using this design
              guide!
            </h3>
            <img src={"./images/F1.png"} className="imageAnalysis" />
            <h3 className="imageTextSmall">
              On this first screen we can clearly see how having consistent
              colors, padding and fonts instantly makes the page more appealable
              for usage. The navigation bar is clear and contains a toggle to
              swtich between engligh and spanish which modifies the whole
              webpage. The carousel is now clear and users know that images
              change and they can manually see all of them.
            </h3>
            <img src={"./images/F2.png"} className="imageAnalysis" />
            <h3 className="imageTextSmall">
              On this next page we can see how text no longer clutters the page.
              We now have clear sections and a coherent structure with padding,
              margins and borders. This makes it easier for the users to
              undersrand what information is being convayed. Additionally, there
              is a coherent structure to the text and videos, they are now
              properlly pared up.

              As mentioned before, the usability of the page is much better as
              finding information about cancer and prevention is readily
              available and easy to see for those with disabilities as the fonts
              sizes and types are consisten and easily readable. All of the
              texts can be ready by aria lables and the videos are also tagged.

                    As we can see, most of the elements are the same as in the
                    desktop version. The main difference is the hamburger menu
                    instead of the navigation bar which helps to reduce
                    cluttering like in the original mobile version. For all
                    other aspects, some of the sections have been streched to
                    maintain readability and avoid cutting elements to the
                    sides. The carousel has its images reduced and the embeded
                    videos have reduced their scale but mantaining their aspect
                    ratio. Elements such as the sections and their layouts are
                    kept the same as the desktop version.

                    the arrows to the sides to indicate there are more images.

                Overall, this project has allowed me to analyze what elements
                constitute a bad website and ways to address these issues.
                Having in mind diferent languages, or a responsive design are
                things that may not come intuitive at a first glance but that
                are crucial for an accesible and easy to use website.
                Additionally, the process of creating a style guide and mockups
                for the webpage helped tremendously as I was able to plan ahead
                and design reusable components for my diferent aspect ratios and
                devices.
